## Project thoughts

Much pro-life rhetoric in the abortion debate surrounds the idea that abortion is the murder of an unborn child. What is the relationship between anti-abortion attitudes and "pro-life" attitudes on other issues centered around murder such as the death penalty and gun control? Is this pro-life attitude consistent among these other issues?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dataset <- read_csv("anes2020.csv") |>
  select(V201342x, V201345x, V202344x, V201350, V201231x) |>
  rename(
    abortion = V201342x,
    deathpenalty = V201345x,
    guncontrol = V202344x,
    internationalforce = V201350,
    partyid = V201231x
  )
